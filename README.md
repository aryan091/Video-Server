##Video Stream

A web application enabling users to upload videos, which are subsequently converted into HLS format for streaming. The frontend, built with React, integrates Video.js for video playback, while the backend, powered by Express.js, handles file uploads and FFmpeg-based conversion processes. Upon successful conversion, the server responds with a URL to access the HLS stream, allowing seamless video playback on the frontend. This setup facilitates efficient video management and streaming capabilities within a straightforward web interface.
